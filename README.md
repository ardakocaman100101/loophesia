# [loophesia](http://loophesia.dev)

A free and open-source webapp for learning to play MIDI Keyboard. You can practice multi-track songs and live looping. Plug in your MIDI keyboard for the optimal experience.

loophesia is still being developed. I work full-time and learn keyboard and pads. I want to create a interactive tool for amateur music makers to practice multi track songs.  

I use another open source project called Sightread for music rendering and some graphics. I will soon develop further:
- Show instrument
- Show track info
- Sample multi track songs
- Live looping controls
- Pad key support
